\subsection{Multiple Query Optimization}
\todo{Here should be a concrete example of query optimization and afterwards extended by multi-query optimization.}
To explain what exactly multiple query optimization is, an everyday situation can be used as an example. For the example, an entity $\mathcal{U}$ has a list $\mathcal{L}$ to go through. The list $\mathcal{L}$ consists of everything $\matchcal{U}$ has to buy at the groceries store. There are four elements in $\mathcal{L} = \left\{ \text{Apple}, \text{Pineapple}, \text{Beef}, \text{Wine}\right\}$. Each element $x \in \mathcal{L}$ has an isle in the store where it is located. To retrieve the item, $\mathcal{U}$ has to go to said isle and pick it up. By looking at the list, we can see that the elements “Pineapple” and “Apple” are both fruits, therefore situated at the same isle. To optimize the path through the store, $\mathcal{U}$ can combine the operation of retrieving the elements “Pineapple” and “Apple” so that he only needs to go to the fruit isle once. \par
In its essence, $\mathcal{U}$ did the optimization of a combinational problem by himself. In any relational database $\mathcal{D}$, the user $\mathcal{U}$ wants to retrieve information $\mathcal{I} \in \mathcal{D}$. For this, the request of information, referred to as \code{query}, is decomposed into single operations. Where the groceries store example had different isles and the path to reach them, $\mathcal{D}$ has stored tables it has to load into memory. Depending on the level of data normalization $\mathcal{D}$ has\cite{semantic_relational_data_model}, different tables have to be combined to result in the desired information $\mathcal{I}$. By considering the ever rising number of users a modern application serves\cite{uber_technologies_inc_uber_2022}, the situation arises where multiple queries are executed at the same time and could potentially be combined, hence the name \emph{multiple query optimization}. If the user $\mathcal{U}$ is replaced by a robot $\mathcal{R}$ that can handle multiple requests at once, he too would be interested in combining operations to save time. So if multiple users $\mathcal{U}_i$ request fruits, he can retrieve them at once and save repetitive steps. \par
The problem of finding the optimal combination is of quadratic nature; which means that it usually takes $O(n^2)$ to find the combination with the most time savings, which also makes it NP-Hard\cite{sellis_multiple-query_1990}. This has been an ongoing problem to solve, with classical algorithms\cite{kathuria_provable_mqo} available that can find a \emph{good enough} solution in a usable timeframe, which can still be improved when it comes to accuracy and time complexity. There are also quantum enhanced proposals\cite{fankhauser_multiple_2021}, which will be used for direct comparison in this thesis.

\subsection{Quantum Neural Network}
Classification of data is a canonical problem in machine learning and has made great strides towards getting classical computers to classify data \cite{Killoran_2019,ClassificationWithQNN}. A reliable method for classifying data is offered by so-called artificial neural networks using supervised learning. Based on the training data, the artificial neural network learns to find a hypothesis that makes predictions that are as accurate as possible. To determine the accuracy, the learned hypothesis can be compared to test data whose solution is known to the classification. This supervised learning algorithm in its basic idea can also be executed on quantum computers. Currently, a common way to create, test and train artificial quantum neural networks is the hybrid classical-quantum algorithm, where only the artificial neural network is implemented as a quantum circuit and the optimization of the parameters is still done classically\cite{mccleanBarrenPlateausQuantum2018,Zhao_2021,schuld_SQMLmodelsAreKernelMethods,sim_expressibility_2019}.
There is currently no general implementation template for quantum neural networks, but various implementation examples and proposals with different classification applications and goals. Also, the available hardware and its access is limited and larger experiments with large datasets cannot yet be performed without a major effort. Nevertheless, in recent years, access to quantum computers has become steadily easier and quantum computation is currently undergoing a transformation from purely academic to industrially used technology\cite{schuldCircuitcentricQuantumClassifiers2020}. Furthermore ...\todo{finish sentences here} leverage the possibility quantum effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference. The experiments hint at potential advantages, such as speed-ups in training, faster processing, parallelization and lesser complexity. ... but the question remains of whether quantum neural networks are more powerful than classical neural networks, is still open
\todo{What about Quantum SVM?}

\subsection{Multiple Query Optimization}
The task when it comes to multiple query optimization is the creation of a quantum circuit that can encode the given problem and find a solution, after being optimized by existing machine learning algorithms. For this, artificially generated data that mimics real life data is used and evaluated. The circuit is automatically generated to best fit the given data and solve the problem accordingly. \par
The goal of this paper is to evaluate the usability of quantum-based solutions that involve concepts of machine learning to solve the multiple query optimization problem. This involves a comparison of runtime, achieved accuracy as well as stability when it comes to results on the simulator and results on real hardware.

\subsection{Quantum Neural Network}
Another goal of this paper is to evaluate different variational quantum circuits which closely resemble Quantum Neural Networks for classification and further compare the results with the Quantum SVM approach done by NAME OF project thesis \todo{ref here}. We pre-trained the weights by a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm approach on quantum simulators using five different binary datasets of two different sizes and additionally the iris dataset with all datapoints and all of its three classes. Finally all quantum circuits are evaluated and analysed on freely available real Quantum hardware from IBM using the datasets and the pre-trained weights.
