\section{Multiple Query Optimization}
\label{chapter:results_mqo}

The non-ML circuit as well as the ML optimized one are run on the simulator as well as on real hardware. For this, the IBM Falcon r4L processor \code{ibmq\_bogota v1.6.37} is used. Each circuit runs 13 times, and the parity function referenced in the chapter \todo{add reference to parity explanation} is used for the ML optimized circuit as well as the non-ML circuit to allow for a direct comparison. For direct comparison, both the ML and non-ML circuit are evaluated using filtered and parity evaluation. The runs are made on a problem space $\left\mathcal{D}_{2\times2}|\right| =\ 300$, out of which 25\%, so 75 records, are taken and evaluated. These 75 records are the same used in the evaluation of the ML optimized circuit in chapter \ref{chapter:mqo_machine_learning}. The results are shown in figures \ref{figure:comparison_ml_noml_filtered_acc} - \ref{figure:ml_rhw_dist}.

The accuracy is determined by the amount of best combinations the circuit evaluated to. The measured data is passed trough a filtered evaluation, which only considers valid combinational keys as results and not all. The ML circuit is not optimized with the filtered evaluation, but with the parity evaluation.}

The distance evaluation is done solely using the filtered evaluation method, as this results in the best accuracy, as shown in figures \ref{figure:comparison_ml_noml_filtered_acc} and \ref{figure:comparison_ml_noml_parity_acc}.

To further evaluate both circuits with new, unseen data, the runs are executed again using a newly generated problem space $\left|\mathcal{D}_{2\times2}\right| =\ 1000$.

\subsection{Advanced Problem Spaces}
\label{chapter:results_advanced_problem_spaces}
As shown in chapter \ref{chapter:approach_and_methods}, the original problem generator was enhanced to allow for any combination of plans to be solved. As shown in chapter \ref{chapter:results_mqo}, the non-ML circuit achieves a better accuracy than its ML counterpart, whilst only losing marginal accuracy when running on real hardware. Due to this and time constraints, these \emph{dynamic} runs are done solely on the simulator using filtered evaluation and the non-ML circuit. The problem spaces are dynamically generated and always of size $\left|\mathcal{D}\right| =\ 5000$. Figure \ref{figure:overview_dynamic_problems} shows a comparison of all evaluated problem spaces $\mathcal{D}$, whilst figures \ref{figure:overview_dynamic_problems} to \ref{figure:bars_dist_3_3_3} show the distances of each run in detail.

\section{Quantum Neural Network}
\label{chapter:results_qnn}
All of the datasets mentioned in \ref{subsection:qnn_datasets_and_acqusition} have been trained, then evaluated on the remote general-purpose simulator \textit{ibmq\_qasm\_simulator} and on a real quantum system. The real quantum system named \textit{ibmq\_manila} uses the \code{Falcon} processor family in revision \code{r5.11} and with segment \code{L}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Family:} refers to the chip architecture. 
    \item \textbf{Revisions:} are design variants within a given family. 
    \item \textbf{Segment:} differentiates processors comprising different sub-sections of a larger chip.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evaluation On Simulator}
For evaluation we chose the weights from the best training run having the highest accuracy for each VQC and dataset. 

\textbf{Simulator:} General-purpose simulator \textit{ibmq\_qasm\_simulator}\footnote{\url{https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/docs/services/manage/simulator/#qasm}}.
