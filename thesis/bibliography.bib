	abstract = {Variational hybrid quantum classical algorithms are a class of quantum algorithms intended to run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) devices. These algorithms employ a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) and a quantum-classical feedback loop. A classical device is used to optimize the parameters in order to minimize a cost function that can be computed far more efficiently on a quantum device. The cost function is constructed such that finding the ansatz parameters that minimize its value, solves some problem of interest. We focus specifically on the variational quantum linear solver, and examine the effect of several gradient-free and gradient-based classical optimizers on performance. We focus on both the average rate of convergence of the classical optimizers studied, as well as the distribution of their average termination cost values, and how these are affected by noise. Our work demonstrates that realistic noise levels on {NISQ} devices present a challenge to the optimization process. All classical optimizers appear to be very negatively affected by the presence of realistic noise. If noise levels are significantly improved, there may be a good reason for preferring gradient-based methods in the future, which performed better than the gradient-free methods with only shot-noise present. The gradient-free optimizers, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation ({SPSA}) and Powell’s method, and the gradient-based optimizers, {AMSGrad} and {BFGS} performed the best in the noisy simulation, and appear to be less affected by noise than the rest of the methods. {SPSA} appears to be the best performing method. {COBYLA}, Nelder–Mead and Conjugate-Gradient methods appear to be the most heavily affected by noise, with even slight noise levels significantly impacting their performance.},

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance of many variational hybrid quantum-classical ({HQC}) algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational {HQC} algorithms.},

We find the quantum state positivity requirements on the Bloch matrix components, leading to three important inequalities, allowing us to parametrize and visualize the two-qubit state space. Applying the singular value decomposition naturally separates the degrees of freedom to local and nonlocal, and simplifies the positivity inequalities. It also allows us to geometrically represent a state as two entangled Bloch spheres with superimposed correlation axes. It is shown that unitary transformations, local or nonlocal, have simple interpretations as axis rotations or mixing of certain degrees of freedom. The nonlocal unitary invariants of the state are then derived in terms of local unitary invariants. The positive partial transpose criterion for entanglement is generalized, and interpreted as a reflection, or a change of a single sign. The formalism is used to characterize maximally entangled states, and generalize two qubit isotropic and Werner states.},

	abstract = {Es wird gezeigt, wie man zu einer Formulierung der Quantenmechanik des magnetischen Elektrons nach der Schrödingerschen Methode der Eigenfunktionen ohne Verwendung zweideutiger Funktionen gelangen kann, indem man, gestützt auf die allgemeine Dirac-Jordansche Transformationstheorie, neben den Ortskoordinaten jedes Elektrons, um seinen rotatorischen Freiheitsgraden Rechnung zu tragen, die Komponente seines Eigenimpulsmomentes in einer festen Richtung als weitere unabhängige Veränderliche einführt. Im Gegensatz zur klassischen Mechanik kann diese Variable jedoch, ganz unabhängig von irgend einer speziellen Art der äußeren Kraftfelder, nur die Werte\$\$ + {\textbackslash}tfrac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}tfrac\{h\}\{\{2{\textbackslash}pi \}\}\$\$und\$\$ - {\textbackslash}tfrac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}tfrac\{h\}\{\{2{\textbackslash}pi \}\}\$\$annehmen. Das Hinzutreten der genannten neuen Variable bewirkt daher bei einem Elektron einfach ein Aufspalten der Eigenfunktion in zwei Ortsfunktionen ψα, ψβ und allgemeiner {beiN} Elektronen in 2NFunktionen, die als die „Wahrscheinlichkeitsamplituden“ dafür zu betrachten sind, daß in einem bestimmten stationären Zustand des Systems nicht nur die Lagenkoordinaten der Elektronen in vorgegebenen infinitesimalen Intervallen liegen, sondern auch die Komponenten ihrer Eigenmomente in der festgewählten Richtung bei ψα zu\$\$ + {\textbackslash}tfrac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}tfrac\{h\}\{\{2{\textbackslash}pi \}\}\$\$, bei ψβ zu\$\$ - {\textbackslash}tfrac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}tfrac\{h\}\{\{2{\textbackslash}pi \}\}\$\$vorgegebene Werte haben. Es werden Methoden angegeben, um bei gegebener Hamiltonscher Funktion des Systems ebenso viele simultane Differentialgleichungen für dieψ Funktionen aufzustellen, als ihre Anzahl beträgt (also 2 bzw. 2N). Diese Gleichungen sind in ihren Folgerungen mit den Matrizengleichungen von Heisenberg und Jordan völlig äquivalent. Ferner wird im Fall mehrerer Elektronen diejenige Lösung der Differentialgleichungen, die der „Äquivalenzregel“ genügt, im Anschluß an Heisenberg und Dirac durch ihre Symmetrieeigenschaften bei Vertauschung der Variablenwerte zweier Elektronen in einfacher Weise charakterisiert.},

abstract = {Complex queries for massive data analysis jobs have become increasingly commonplace. Many such queries contain common subexpressions, either within a single query or among multiple queries submitted as a batch. Conventional query optimizers do not exploit these subexpressions and produce sub-optimal plans. The problem of multi-query optimization (MQO) is to generate an optimal combined evaluation plan by computing common subexpressions once and reusing them. Exhaustive algorithms for MQO explore an O(nn) search space. Thus, this problem has primarily been tackled using various heuristic algorithms, without providing any theoretical guarantees on the quality of their solution.In this paper, instead of the conventional cost minimization problem, we treat the problem as maximizing a linear transformation of the cost function. We propose a greedy algorithm for this transformed formulation of the problem, which under weak, intuitive assumptions, provides an approximation factor guarantee for this formulation. We go on to show that this factor is optimal, unless P = NP. An- other noteworthy point about our algorithm is that it can be easily incorporated into existing transformation-based optimizers. We finally propose optimizations which can be used to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to solve difficult optimization problems in chemistry, physics and mathematics more efficiently than classical computers, but requires fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. To overcome errors introduced by today's quantum computers, hybrid algorithms combining classical and quantum computers are used. In this paper we tackle the multiple query optimization problem ({MQO}) which is an important {NP}-hard problem in the area of data-intensive problems. We propose a novel hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to solve the {MQO} on a gate-based quantum computer. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our algorithm and compare its performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer -- another type of quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm currently can only handle small problem sizes due to the limited number of qubits available on a gate-based quantum computer compared to a quantum computer based on quantum annealing. However, our algorithm shows a qubit efficiency of close to 99\% which is almost a factor of 2 higher compared to the state of the art implementation. Finally, we analyze how our algorithm scales with larger problem sizes and conclude that our approach shows promising results for near-term quantum computers.},

Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

	abstract = {Complex queries for massive data analysis jobs have become increasingly commonplace. Many such queries contain com- mon subexpressions, either within a single query or among multiple queries submitted as a batch. Conventional query optimizers do not exploit these subexpressions and produce sub-optimal plans. The problem of multi-query optimization ({MQO}) is to generate an optimal combined evaluation plan by computing common subexpressions once and reusing them. Exhaustive algorithms for {MQO} explore an O(n{\textasciicircum}n) search space. Thus, this problem has primarily been tackled using various heuristic algorithms, without providing any theoretical guarantees on the quality of their solution. In this paper, instead of the conventional cost minimization problem, we treat the problem as maximizing a linear transformation of the cost function. We propose a greedy algorithm for this transformed formulation of the problem, which under weak, intuitive assumptions, provides an approximation factor guarantee for this formulation. We go on to show that this factor is optimal, unless P = {NP}. Another noteworthy point about our algorithm is that it can be easily incorporated into existing transformation-based optimizers. We finally propose optimizations which can be used to improve the efficiency of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

It outlines the challenge of combining the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics of neural computing and the linear, unitary dynamics of quantum computing. It establishes requirements for a meaningful QNN and reviews existing literature against these requirements. It is found that none of the proposals for a potential QNN model fully exploits both the advantages of quantum physics and computing in neural networks.

Their monotonicity, individual derivatives, and finite of their range are some of these characteristics (Bach 2017).

Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

    ABSTRACT = {Classification problems and their corresponding solving approaches constitute one of the fields of machine learning. The application of classification schemes in Renewable Energy (RE) has gained significant attention in the last few years, contributing to the deployment, management and optimization of RE systems. The main objective of this paper is to review the most important classification algorithms applied to RE problems, including both classical and novel algorithms. The paper also provides a comprehensive literature review and discussion on different classification techniques in specific RE problems, including wind speed/power prediction, fault diagnosis in RE systems, power quality disturbance classification and other applications in alternative RE systems. In this way, the paper describes classification techniques and metrics applied to RE problems, thus being useful both for researchers dealing with this kind of problem and for practitioners of the field.},

  abstract={Two machine-learning procedures have been investigated in some detail using the game of checkers. Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Furthermore, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of machine learning verified by these experiments are, of course, applicable to many other situations.},

  abstract={A new signature table technique is described together with an improved book learning procedure which is thought to be much superior to the linear polynomial method described earlier. Full use is made of the so called “alpha-beta” pruning and several forms of forward pruning to restrict the spread of the move tree and to permit the program to look ahead to a much greater depth than it otherwise could do. While still unable to outplay checker masters, the program's playing ability has been greatly improved.},
