	abstract = {In 3D computer graphics and solid modeling, a polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object. The faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.
The study of polygon meshes is a large sub-field of computer graphics (specifically 3D computer graphics) and geometric modeling. Different representations of polygon meshes are used for different applications and goals. The variety of operations performed on meshes may include: Boolean logic, smoothing, simplification, and many others. Algorithms also exist for ray tracing, collision detection, and rigid-body dynamics with polygon meshes. If the mesh's edges are rendered instead of the faces, then the model becomes a wireframe model.
Volumetric meshes are distinct from polygon meshes in that they explicitly represent both the surface and volume of a structure, while polygon meshes only explicitly represent the surface (the volume is implicit).
Several methods exist for mesh generation, including the marching cubes algorithm.},

	abstract = {In 1996, Nintendo blew gamers minds and released the latest iteration of the Super Mario franchise, featuring a fully 3D world that would set the tone for every 3D platform to come. We were also introduced to a version of Mario we'd never seen before, made of polygons, rather than pixels.

Mario has changed a lot since Super Mario 64, but, just how much? I think it's time we get reacquainted. This is Low Poly!

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to solve difficult optimization problems in chemistry, physics and mathematics more efficiently than classical computers, but requires fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. To overcome errors introduced by today's quantum computers, hybrid algorithms combining classical and quantum computers are used. In this paper we tackle the multiple query optimization problem ({MQO}) which is an important {NP}-hard problem in the area of data-intensive problems. We propose a novel hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to solve the {MQO} on a gate-based quantum computer. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our algorithm and compare its performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer -- another type of quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm currently can only handle small problem sizes due to the limited number of qubits available on a gate-based quantum computer compared to a quantum computer based on quantum annealing. However, our algorithm shows a qubit efficiency of close to 99\% which is almost a factor of 2 higher compared to the state of the art implementation. Finally, we analyze how our algorithm scales with larger problem sizes and conclude that our approach shows promising results for near-term quantum computers.},

	abstract = {An important application for near-term quantum computing lies in optimization tasks, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry and drug discovery to machine learning. In many settings --- most prominently in so-called parametrized or variational algorithms --- the objective function is a result of hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective, it is useful to have access to exact gradients of quantum circuits with respect to gate parameters. This paper shows how gradients of expectation values of quantum measurements can be estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture that executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results for qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the computation of gradients of continuous-variable circuits. Interestingly, in many important instances it is sufficient to run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the gradient. More general cases can be solved by conditioning a single gate on an ancilla.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines ({SVMs}) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional {SVMs}. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

Cox regression was used to model mortality considering age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium, anemia, platelets, creatinine phosphokinase, blood pressure, gender, diabetes and smoking status as potentially contributing for mortality. Kaplan Meier plot was used to study the general pattern of survival which showed high intensity of mortality in the initial days and then a gradual increase up to the end of study. Martingale residuals were used to assess functional form of variables. Results were validated computing calibration slope and discrimination ability of model via bootstrapping.

	abstract = {Parameterized quantum circuits play an essential role in the performance of many variational hybrid quantum-classical ({HQC}) algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational {HQC} algorithms.},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

Ebenfelt proposed a conjecture regarding the possible ranks of the Hermitian polynomials in \$z,{\textbackslash}bar z\$ of the form \$A(z,{\textbackslash}bar z){\textbackslash}{\textbar}z{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\$, known as the {SOS} Conjecture, where {SOS} stands for "sums of squares". In this article, we employed and extended the recent techniques developed for local orthogonal maps to study this conjecture and its generalizations to arbitrary signatures. We proved that for a given Hermitian form \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}cdot,{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}rangle\_{\textbackslash}star\$ on \${\textbackslash}mathbb C{\textasciicircum}n\$ of any signature with at least two non-zero eigenvalues, the ranks of the Hermitian polynomials of the form \$A(z,{\textbackslash}bar z){\textbackslash}{\textbar}z{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}2\_{\textbackslash}star\$ do not lie in a finite number of non-trivial gaps on the real line. Not only is this consistent with the {SOS} Conjecture, but it also demonstrates that in fact the conjecture qualitatively holds in all signatures except the trivial ones. In addition, these gaps can be explicitly calculated in terms of \$n\$ and the signature of \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}cdot,{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}rangle\_{\textbackslash}star\$, and the number of such gaps and their sizes are of the same order as those stated in the {SOS} Conjecture.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers have enabled solving problems beyond the current computers' capabilities. However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four {IBM} Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88{\textbackslash}\% and 69{\textbackslash}\% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively.},

	abstract = {Noise dominates every aspect of near-term quantum computers, rendering it exceedingly difficult to carry out even small computations. In this paper we are concerned with the modelling of noise in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum ({NISQ}) computers. We focus on three error groups that represent the main sources of noise during a computation and present quantum channels that model each source. We engineer a noise model that combines all three noise channels and simulates the evolution of the quantum computer using its calibrated error rates. We run various experiments of our model, showcasing its behaviour compared to other noise models and an {IBM} quantum computer. We find that our model provides a better approximation of the quantum computer's behaviour than the other models. Following this, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters used by our noise model, bringing the behaviour of the model even closer to the quantum computer. Finally, a comparison between the pre and postoptimization parameters reveals that, according to our model, certain operations can be more or less erroneous than the hardware-calibrated parameters show.},

	shorttitle = {Learning on Hardware},
	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have the advantage that they can take into account a large number of parameters, which enables them to solve complex tasks. In computer vision and speech recognition, they have a better accuracy than common algorithms, and in some tasks, they boast an even higher accuracy than human experts. With the progress of {DNNs} in recent years, many other fields of application such as diagnosis of diseases and autonomous driving are taking advantage of them. The trend at {DNNs} is clear: The network size is growing exponentially, which leads to an exponential increase in computational effort and required memory size. For this reason, optimized hardware accelerators are used to increase the performance of the inference of neuronal networks. However, there are various neural network hardware accelerator platforms, such as graphics processing units ({GPUs}), application specific integrated circuits ({ASICs}) and field programmable gate arrays ({FPGAs}). Each of these platforms offer certain advantages and disadvantages. Also, there are various methods for reducing the computational effort of {DNNs}, which are differently suitable for each hardware accelerator. In this article an overview of existing neural network hardware accelerators and acceleration methods is given. Their strengths and weaknesses are shown and a recommendation of suitable applications is given. In particular, we focus on acceleration of the inference of convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) used for image recognition tasks. Given that there exist many different hardware architectures. {FPGA}-based implementations are well-suited to show the effect of {DNN} optimization methods on accuracy and throughput. For this reason, the focus of this work is more on {FPGA}-based implementations.},

	abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},
